# IoT-Based-Air-Pollution-Monitoring-System-with-Temperature-and-Humidity-Sensing
This IoT system monitors air quality, temperature, and humidity using MQ135, DHT11, and ESP8266. It provides real-time data, alerts for hazardous air levels, and remote access via a web interface. Designed for affordability, it ensures convenience, awareness, and accessibility with on-screen and online displays.
The primary objective of this project is to develop an IoT-based system capable of continuously monitoring air quality, temperature, and humidity. The system will provide real-time data and alerts for poor air quality conditions. Additionally, it will allow users to remotely access this data through a web interface, ensuring convenience and increased awareness. The system’s functionalities will include:
•	Real-time monitoring of air quality, temperature, and humidity.
•	Alerts for hazardous air quality levels (good, poor, very bad, toxic, dangerous).
•	Easy-to-read display of the collected data on screen.
•	Web interface for remote access to air quality data.
1.4	Proposed Solution
This system utilizes an MQ135 gas sensor for detecting air pollution levels and a DHT11 sensor for measuring temperature and humidity using ESP8266 microcontroller. The collected data is shown on display and can also be accessed remotely through a web interface. The system will trigger visual and optional audible alerts when air quality reaches dangerous levels, ensuring immediate awareness. The design is kept low-cost to make it accessible for a wide range of users and environments.
